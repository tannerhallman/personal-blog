          In this blog, I share tidbits from my development experience and my
          entrepreneurial journey building my own SaaS product.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a co-founder of <a href="https://coworksapp.com/">Coworks</a>, a
          flexible office space management platform, and I'm passionate about
          learning, improving my skills, and sharing that knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cover everything from my experience with new libraries, ways I've
          grown as a engineer, and how I've applied my knowledge to build
          Coworks!
        </p>
        <p>
          I code in ReactJS, Kotlin/Java for Android, Rails on the backend, and
          React Native daily and I hope to provide something useful to you.
        </p>
